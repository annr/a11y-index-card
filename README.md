# Accessibility Index Card
## Quick, high-level reminders for creating accessible web applications

1. 🏠 **Structure**: Content is well-organized and uses appropriate HTML tags
2. 🌗 **Contrast, Color and Typeface**: Text content has sufficient contrast, information is not conveyed by color, and typefaces are easy to read
3. 💬 **Content Alternatives**: Content is consumable by users who can’t see or hear by providing alternatives such as Captions
4. 🚌 **Easy to get around**: Product is easy to navigate, consistent and predictable
5. 🚨 **Information and Errors**: Product helps people avoid error states and recover from errors
6. 💪 **User Control and Preferences**: People can override auto-playing media, animations, and time limits on actions
7. 📝 **Clarity**: Product uses succinct, descriptive text
8. ♻️ **Flexibility**: Content adjusts to custom sizes, styles, and viewing modes

## Motivation and Justification
You may be thinking..."There are a lot of accessibility guides out there. Why do we need this one?"

**This guide balances being an introduction to web accessibilty with being a reminder of the most impactful considerations.**

Each of these points will be explored in chapters.

As far as I know, no other accessiblity guide shares information and ownership across functional areas as well as this one does. It's an accessible accessiblity guide. :P


## About

The Accessiblity Index Card is inspired by [The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn't Have to Be Complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Index_Card)

The motivation for creating the personal finance index card was to make a subject that intimidates people more approachable.

Likewise, building accessible software is difficult and intimidating. This Accessiblity Index Card aims to trigger reminders and convey the considerations required to make web sites WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant.

For people and teams who are trying to build accessbile web applications, you can print this card out and keep it visible where you work.

The Accessiblity Index Card was created by me, Ann, with input from others and especially by Deque's [Quick Accessibility Checklist for Designers](https://accessibility.deque.com/quick-accessibility-checklist-designers-download)

Thanks for caring about this stuff.
