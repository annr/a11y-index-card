# Accessibility Index Card
## Quick, high-level reminders for creating web applications

1. 🏠 **Structure**: Content is well-organized and uses appropriate HTML tags
2. 🌗 **Contrast, Color and Typeface**: Text content has sufficient contrast, information is not conveyed by color, and typefaces are easy to read
3. 💬 **Content Alternatives**: People who are blind or deaf can use the site
4. 🚌 **Easy to get around**: Product is easy to navigate, consistent and predictable
5. 🚨 **Information and Errors**: Product helps people avoid error states and recover from errors
6. 💪 **User Control and Preferences**: People can override auto-playing media, animations, and time limits on actions
7. 📝 **Clarity**: Product uses succinct, descriptive text
8. ♻️ **Flexibility**: Content adjusts to custom sizes, styles, and viewing modes

## Motivation and Justification
You may be thinking..."There are a lot of accessibility guides out there. Why do we need this one?"

This guide balances being an introduction to accessibilty with being a useful reminder for people with more experience creating accessible web applications.

As far as I know, no other accessiblity guide shares information and ownership across functional areas as well as this one does. It's an accessible accessiblity guide. :P


## Version notes

This is going to be the last and final version. Although text may change a little bit, there's no reason to show the evolution from here on.

Changed subheading in an attempt to make the use case sound like it is for everyone to use.

Removed "Device independence." All of the points of the index card have aspects that are in support of device independence.

Added emojis to the points to give them a little color and character.

## About

The Accessiblity Index Card is inspired by [The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn't Have to Be Complicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Index_Card)

The motivation for creating the personal finance index card was to make a subject that intimidates people more approachable.

Likewise, building accessible software is difficult and intimidating. This Accessiblity Index Card aims to trigger reminders and convey the considerations required to make web sites WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant.

For people and teams who are trying to build accessbile web applications, you can print this card out and keep it visible where you work.

The Accessiblity Index Card was created by me, Ann, with input from others and inspired by Deque's [Quick Accessibility Checklist for Designers](https://accessibility.deque.com/quick-accessibility-checklist-designers-download)

Thanks for caring about this stuff.
