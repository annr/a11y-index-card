# Accessibility Index Card v3

1. **Content is logically organized**, and uses appropriate HTML tags

2. Site **can be used with different devices**; screen reader, keyboard, touch screen...

3. **Content is legible**; it has sufficient contrast, is resizable, and information is not conveyed by color alone

4. Users who **canâ€™t see or hear can use** the site

5. Site is **easy to navigate** and the design is consistent throughout

6. Site **helps users avoid error states**, and recover from errors

7. **Users can override** auto-playing media, animations, and time limits on actions

8. Site uses the shortest, sufficiently **descriptive text** possible

## Version notes

I plan to use each of these main points as chapters in an accessibility guide I'm developing for my company. This version of the Accessibility Index Card moves towards distilling the points into chapter headings or labels.

This version incorporates feedback from an accessibility guru friend of mine. Thanks B!

## Thoughts

The Accessiblity Index Card is inspired by the personal finance index card: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Index_Card

The motivation for creating the personal finance index card was to make a subject that intimidates people more approachable.

Likewise, building accessible software is difficult and intimidating. This Accessiblity Index Card aims to trigger reminders and convey the considerations required to make web sites WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant.

For people and teams who are trying to build accessbile web applications, you can print this card out and keep it visible where you work.
