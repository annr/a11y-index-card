# Accessibility Index Card v4
## Points to keep in mind to ensure accessibility

1. **Structure**: Content is well-organized, and uses appropriate HTML tags
2. **Device Independence**: Product can be used with screen readers, keyboards, touch screens
3. **Contrast, Color and Typeface**: Content as sufficient contrast, information is not conveyed by color alone, and selected typefaces are easy to read
4. **Text Alternatives**: People who canâ€™t see or hear can use the site
5. **Navigation**: Product is easy to navigate and people know where they are
6. **Consistent Design**: Product is consistent and predictable
7. **Information and Errors**: Product helps users avoid error states, and recover from errors
8. **User Control and Preferences**: People can override auto-playing media, animations, and time limits on actions
9. **Wording**: Product uses succinct, descriptive text
10. **Flexibility**: Content gracefully adjusts to custom sizes and styles, and viewing modes

## Version notes

This version introduces concise chapter headings. I incorporated feedback from a few Khan Academy developers and designers, and especially from Andrew Lee, a designer.

Andrew and I worked hard to evolve the Accessibility Index Card towards something people in all functions can use. We want to make the ultimate accessibility guide that grows out of Accessibility Index Card to be a reference for all stages of the product development lifecycle.

Also added subheading.

## Thoughts

The Accessiblity Index Card is inspired by the personal finance index card: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Index_Card

The motivation for creating the personal finance index card was to make a subject that intimidates people more approachable.

Likewise, building accessible software is difficult and intimidating. This Accessiblity Index Card aims to trigger reminders and convey the considerations required to make web sites WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant.

For people and teams who are trying to build accessbile web applications, you can print this card out and keep it visible where you work.
