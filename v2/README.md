## Thoughts

The Accessiblity Index Card is inspired by the personal finance index card: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Index_Card

The motivation for creating the personal finance index card was to make a subject that intimidates people more approachable.

Likewise, building accessible software is difficult and intimidating. This Accessiblity Index Card aims to trigger reminders and convey the considerations required to make web sites WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant.

For people and teams who are trying to build accessbile web applications, you can print this card out and keep it visible where you work.
